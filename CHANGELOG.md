## [1.4.4] - 2025-12-15

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Fixed translation button state during language download** - Button no longer toggles to "See Original" prematurely

  - Uses `.sensoryFeedback(.success)` modifier for native iOS haptics

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Fixed translation caching** - Translations now persist when toggling off/on
  - Removed `translations.removeAll()` and `translationConfig = nil` when disabling translations
  - Translations are now cached in memory for instant re-display
  - Significantly improves UX for users toggling between original and translated text

## [1.4.2] - 2025-12-14

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Fixed translate button text color** - Removed incorrect foreground color override
  - The translate button now properly inherits system colors for better readability
  - Previously used custom foreground color that could cause visibility issues

## [1.4.1] - 2025-12-14

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Fixed ambiguous type lookup error** - Removed old renamed files from public SDK repository
  - Deleted `FeaturePulseConfiguration.swift` (renamed to `FeaturePulse.swift` in v1.4.0)
  - Deleted `FeatureRequestRestrictionMode.swift` (renamed to `RestrictionMode.swift` in v1.4.0)
  - This fixes "FeaturePulse is ambiguous for type lookup" error when adding the package remotely via SPM

### 🔧 Improvements

- **Enhanced release process** - Added automated release script and improved sync process
  - Uses `rsync --delete` to ensure clean syncing between monorepo and public repo
  - Prevents old renamed files from lingering in the public repository
  - Better verification steps before committing releases

## [1.4.0] - 2025-12-14

### ✨ New Features

- **Clean Nested Type Architecture** - Following Amplitude's pattern
  - `Payment` → `FeaturePulse.Payment`
  - `FeatureRequestRestrictionMode` → `FeaturePulse.RestrictionMode`
  - `FeaturePulseL10n` → `FeaturePulse.L10n`
  - Each type in separate file using extensions
  - Internal typealiases for SDK convenience
  - No naming collisions with module name

### 🔧 Improvements

- **Simplified Main Class** - Renamed `FeaturePulseConfiguration` → `FeaturePulse`
  - Removed unnecessary typealias
  - Cleaner, more intuitive API
  - File renamed to `FeaturePulse.swift`

- **Better Callback Support** - Changed `RestrictionMode.callback` to `@MainActor`
  - Can now capture `@State` properties
  - Perfect for showing paywalls and UI operations
  - Removed unnecessary `DispatchQueue.main.async` wrapper

- **Documentation Updates**
  - Removed generic/obvious comments
  - Updated payment examples to include required `currency` parameter
  - Clearer code documentation

### ⚠️ Breaking Changes

- **Main class renamed**: `FeaturePulseConfiguration` → `FeaturePulse`
  - If you used `FeaturePulseConfiguration.shared`, change to `FeaturePulse.shared`
  - Most users already used `FeaturePulse.shared` via typealias (no change needed)

- **Nested types**: Types are now nested under `FeaturePulse`
  - `Payment` → `FeaturePulse.Payment` (internal typealias for compatibility)
  - `FeatureRequestRestrictionMode` → `FeaturePulse.RestrictionMode` (internal typealias for compatibility)
  - `FeaturePulseL10n` → `FeaturePulse.L10n`
  - **Usage with type inference is unchanged**: `.free`, `.monthly()`, etc. still work

- **RestrictionMode callback**: Changed from `@Sendable` to `@MainActor`
  - More flexible, allows capturing UI state
  - No impact unless you relied on Sendable conformance

### 📦 Migration Guide

Most code works without changes due to type inference:

```swift
// Before (still works)
FeaturePulse.shared.updateUser(payment: .free)
FeaturePulse.shared.restrictionMode = .alert(subscriptionName: "Pro")

// Explicit type references (if you have them)
// Before: let payment: Payment = .free
// After:  let payment: FeaturePulse.Payment = .free

// Localization
// Before: Label(FeaturePulseL10n.featureRequests, ...)
// After:  Label(FeaturePulse.L10n.featureRequests, ...)
```

## [1.2.0] - 2025-12-14

### ✨ New Features

- **Feature Request Restrictions** - Restrict feature creation to paying users
  - Dashboard toggle to require subscription for creating feature requests
  - Free users can still vote on existing requests
  - Two restriction modes:
    - `.alert(subscriptionName:)` - Show alert with customizable subscription name (default: "Pro")
    - `.callback` - Custom handler for showing paywalls or navigation
  - Checks `payment_type` instead of MRR (supports gifted subscriptions with $0 MRR)
  - All three "Request Feature" buttons respect permissions (toolbar, CTA, empty state)

- **Clean API with Typealias** - Shorter, more elegant SDK usage
  - `FeaturePulse` typealias for `FeaturePulseConfiguration`
  - Use `FeaturePulse.shared` instead of `FeaturePulseConfiguration.shared`
  - New `view()` convenience method: `FeaturePulse.shared.view()` returns `FeaturePulseView` instance

- **Safe Enum Decoding** - Resilient to unknown enum values from API
  - `@Default<FirstCase>` property wrapper for enum properties
  - Prevents crashes when API returns unknown status values
  - Automatically falls back to first case if value is unrecognized

### 🎨 API Improvements

- Simplified restriction configuration:
  ```swift
  // Default - shows alert with "Pro"
  // No configuration needed

  // Custom subscription name
  FeaturePulse.shared.restrictionMode = .alert(subscriptionName: "Premium")

  // Custom callback
  FeaturePulse.shared.restrictionMode = .callback {
      showPaywallSheet()
  }
  ```

- Cleaner SDK initialization:
  ```swift
  // Old
  FeaturePulseConfiguration.shared.apiKey = "key"

  // New
  FeaturePulse.shared.apiKey = "key"
  ```

- Convenient view instantiation:
  ```swift
  // Direct instantiation (still works)
  FeaturePulseView()

  // New convenience method
  FeaturePulse.shared.view()
  ```

### 🔒 Restriction Behavior

- **Paid users** (weekly, monthly, yearly, lifetime) → Can create feature requests
- **Gifted subscriptions** → Can create (even with $0 MRR)
- **Free users** → Cannot create, see restriction message
- **Everyone** → Can vote on existing requests

### 📚 Documentation

- Updated README with new API examples
- Added Feature Request Restrictions section
- Documented restriction modes and usage patterns
- Updated all code examples to use `FeaturePulse.shared`
